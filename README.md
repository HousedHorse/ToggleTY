# ToggleTY

A vim plugin I wrote to toggle a terminal window for the user's convenience.

## Requirements

This has been tested on Neovim and is currently in beta. I'm thinking that the terminal
mapping will be an issue for regular vim users. I plan to fix this in the release version.

## Installation

### Pathogen or Vundle

`cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone https://github.com/HousedHorse/ToggleTY`

## Usage

By default, press `<C-B>` to toggle the terminal window on and off. *It's that simple.*

All key-bindings and settings are customizable. See documentation in the help menu for more info.

## Documentation

When the plugin is installed, type `:h ToggleTY` for all necessary info.
